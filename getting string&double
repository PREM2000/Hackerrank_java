}

input:
776
887.6
hello world

output:
String: hello world
Double: 887.6
Int: 776

REASON:
In Scanner class if we call nextLine() method after any one of the seven nextXXX() method then the nextLine() doesnâ€™t not read values
from console and cursor will not come into console it will skip that step.
The nextXXX() methods are nextInt(), nextFloat(), nextByte(), nextShort(), nextDouble(), nextLong(), next().

In BufferReader class there is no such type of problem.
This problem occurs only for Scanner class, due to nextXXX() methods ignore newline character and nextLine() only reads till firstnewline
character. If we use one more call of nextLine() method between nextXXX() and nextLine(), then this problem will not occur because nextLine() 
will consume the newline character.
